# Welcome
This repository contains my efforts to create a tutorial for debugging with gdb. The subjects covered vary and in general the problems presented increase in difficulty with each problem. The problems contained herein are not actual problems as one might find in a textbook requiring the user to supply a solution. For each problem, the accompanying guide will hopefully assist the user in walking through various aspects of debugging.

# Setup
* Clone this repository
* Open a terminal in the cloned repository
* Run the make command to build the problems
* Open the workbook.rtf file using your favourite editor
* Optionally open gdb_tutorial.pdf using a pdf editor to review your GDB skills
* Enjoy!
